This repository showcases a comprehensive project on Market Basket Analysis and Customer Segmentation, utilizing the Apriori Algorithm and K-Means Clustering to derive valuable insights from retail store data. The objective is twofold: first, to identify associations between products frequently purchased together, enabling the discovery of actionable product bundling strategies, and second, to segment customers into four distinct clusters based on their purchasing patterns, aiding in targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.

The data, sourced from a retail store, underwent extensive preprocessing using powerful Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. This step ensured the removal of inconsistencies, handled missing values, and transformed the dataset into a clean, structured format ready for analysis. For Market Basket Analysis, the Apriori Algorithm was implemented to uncover frequent product combinations and generate association rules, providing crucial insights for cross-selling and upselling strategies. 

For customer segmentation, K-Means Clustering was applied to categorize customers into four groups based on key purchasing characteristics. These clusters help businesses better understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies to suit each segment's unique behavior. The entire process was visualized using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, allowing for clear and interactive representation of both data and results.

The development and execution of this project were conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment, ensuring a smooth and iterative workflow. This project demonstrates how data analysis techniques can be applied in the retail industry to optimize marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve inventory management. It is a practical example of the power of machine learning and data visualization in deriving actionable insights from raw data.

CHAPTER 01
INTRODUCTION

Retail businesses constantly seek ways to understand and predict customer behavior to optimize operations and improve profitability. Market Basket Analysis provides actionable insights into customer purchasing patterns by identifying associations between products in transaction data. The goal is to uncover relationships that can inform various business strategies, from product placement to inventory management and marketing campaigns.

Market Basket Analysis:

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a technique in retail analytics that examines transactional data to identify relationships between items purchased together. The key outcome of MBA is the generation of "association rules," which indicate how items are related to each other in a dataset. For example:

If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter.

If a customer buys diapers, they often buy baby wipes.

These insights can guide decisions on product placement, bundling, and promotions. By understanding these associations, businesses can enhance their sales strategies, improve customer experience, and increase profitability.


Retail businesses face challenges in understanding customer purchasing behavior, which limits their ability to:

-	Optimize product placement to drive sales and enhance customer convenience.

-	Identify frequently purchased product combinations to design attractive bundle offers.

-	Effectively segment customers to deliver personalized marketing campaigns.

Manage inventory efficiently, ensuring popular items are always in stock while avoiding overstock of less-demanded products.

The lack of actionable insights into transaction data hinders retailers' ability to make data-driven decisions, leading to missed opportunities in improving profitability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
	
The “Market Basket Analysis (MBA)” project, powered by machine learning algorithms such as “Apriori” for association rule mining and “K-Means clustering” for customer segmentation, is built on a structured and systematic design and methodology. The main objective is to analyse transaction datasets, discover patterns in purchasing behaviour, and derive actionable insights to improve retail strategies. This section expands on the design architecture and methodology used in the project, which outlines step by step, from collecting data to evaluating results to visualization.

Project Design Overview:

 The design of this project uses a “modular architecture” in which every phase adds to the final objective of obtaining meaningful insights from transactional data. The flow of this project can be broadly bifurcated into the following stages:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing.
2. Frequent Itemset Mining with Apriori Algorithm.
3. Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering.
4. Measures of Patterns and Rules Evaluation.
5. Result Visualization and Interpretation.
6. Deployment and Reporting.
7. Challenges and Mitigations. 

All the above steps are dependent on each other, making a smooth pipeline from raw data to actionable insights.

1 Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data collection is the initial phase of the project, where raw datasets of transactions are collected and processed for analysis.

> Dataset Description: 
The dataset applied is the “Online Retail Dataset” from the “UCI Machine Learning Repository”. 
It comprises fields such as “Invoice Number”, “Stock Code”, “Description”, “Quantity”, “Invoice Date”, “Unit Price”, and “Customer ID”.

> Data Preprocessing Steps: 

> Handling Missing Values: Rows with null or incomplete values should be removed, especially for important fields like `Customer ID`. 

> Duplicate Removal: Remove duplicate records to prevent bias. 

> Data Formatting: Format date entries, numeric fields, and text descriptions into standardized forms.

> Transaction Binning: Transactions are grouped based on the invoice number to represent the market baskets effectively.  

> Encoding Transactions: Transactions are converted into a binary format wherein each row represents a basket and each column represents a product.  

> Outcome of Preprocessing:
   
   - Clean and structured dataset ready for algorithm implementation.

   - Improved quality of data yields results that are accurate and more meaningful.

2   Frequent Itemset Mining with Apriori Algorithm

The heart of the Market Basket Analysis process is the “Apriori Algorithm”. The algorithm helps identify the items that go together most in shopping, determining their rules for associations.


Goal of Apriori

Discover frequent item sets to appear in transactions together.
Derive association rules by threshold criteria like: “Support”, “Confidence” and “Lift”.

Apriori Process: 

Step 1: Specifies Minimum Support Level: An appropriate support level is defined through which only the frequent item sets are derived after the filtration process.

Step 2: Generate the Candidate Itemset: the pair of items, tripes etc., are selected from the database.

Step 3: Support Evaluation: Compute the support for each itemset and filter out those below the threshold.  

Step 4: Rule Generation: Generate rules based on the frequent item sets.  

Step 5: Confidence and Lift Evaluation: Filter the rules by minimum confidence and lift thresholds.

Metrics Used in Rule Evaluation:

Support: Times an itemset occurs in transaction.  

Confidence: Probability of buying item B if item A is also bought.  

Lift: Strength of an association rule (values >1 a positive correlation).

Result of Apriori Analysis:  It identifies strong product associations. Understanding frequent item sets, for example: Customers who purchase chips are likely to purchase drinks.

3 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering:

 K-Means Clustering” is used for customer segmentation. This type of clustering technique categorizes customers into different groups based on their purchasing behaviour.
Goal of K-Means:
   Segment customers into relevant groups.
  Identify patterns in purchasing frequency, transaction amounts, and product preferences.

K-Means Workflow:
Step 1: Data Preparation: Extract customer-specific metrics including:
      		Total Spend: Total expenditure per customer.
      		Average Basket Size: Mean number of items per transaction.
     		Visit Frequency: Number of transactions per customer.  
Step 2: Choose Number of Clusters (k): Use the “Elbow Method” to find the right number of clusters.  
Step 3: Cluster Assignment: Assign each customer to a cluster using the closest centroid.
Step 4: Update Centroids: Calculate new centroids and continue until convergence.
Result of Clustering Analysis: Three distinct customer groups: High-value customers, Frequent Shoppers, and One-time buyers. 

4.4 Measures of Patterns and Rules Evaluation: 

To guarantee the correctness of association rules and the outcome of clustering, evaluation measures are used:
Apriori Evaluation Metrics:  
  	Support, Confidence, and Lift thresholds validate rule significance.  
  	Rules with high Lift (>1) are prioritized for actionable insights.
K-Means Evaluation Metrics:  
   	Inertia: Measures cluster tightness.  
  	Silhouette Score: Evaluates how well customers are assigned to clusters.  
Davies-Bouldin Index: Measures clustering performance.
These metrics will make patterns statistically significant and actionable in nature.

4.5 Result Visualization and Interpretation:

Visualization acts as a gateway between analysis and decision, by depicting the intricate web of data into understandable models.
o	Association Rule Visualization:
	Heatmaps for showcasing the frequency of product combos.  
	Directed graphs to depict an association rule.
	Customer Segmentation Visualization
	Scatter plots depicting the customer clusters.  
	Bar charts to emphasize characteristics of each cluster in the form of average spend or visit frequency, for instance.
o	Inference from Visualization:  
	Identification of key product bundles  
	Behaviour of customers across different clusters
	Optimizing store layout and marketing campaign.
 4.6 Deployment and Reporting:

After drawing insights, the project is deployed and reported on:
o	Deployment Environment:
•	Local Deployment using “Jupyter Notebook” or “Flask/Django Web Interface”.  
•	Cloud Deployment on “AWS” or “Google Cloud Platform (GCP)”.
o	Interactive Dashboards:  
•	Tools like “Streamlit” are used to create real-time dashboards for stakeholders.
o	Project Report:
•	Detailed documentation of objectives, algorithms, findings, future recommendations

 4.7 Challenges and Mitigations:


o	Data Imbalance: Resolved through careful threshold in the Apriori algorithm.

o	Cluster Overlap: Addressed by tuning hyperparameters in K-Means.

o	Scalability: Use of optimised python libraries for larger datasets.

•	Quantity & Unit Price: Critical for calculating total revenue and filtering invalid transactions.

•	InvoiceDate: Enables time-series analysis of purchasing behavior.

•	CustomerID: Allows tracking customer loyalty and purchasing patterns.

•	Country: Supports geographical analysis of sales trends.

5.3 Data Cleaning

•	Null values are identified and removed.

•	Irrelevant or duplicate records are filtered out.


The provided code focuses on handling order cancellations in a retail dataset by identifying valid counterparts for negative Quantity values. A deep copy of the dataset is created, and a new column, QuantityCanceled, is initialized with zeros. The code iterates through each row, skipping rows with positive quantities or descriptions marked as 'Discount'. For rows with negative quantities, it filters potential valid counterparts (retail_test) by matching CustomerID, StockCode, earlier InvoiceDate, and positive Quantity. If no valid counterpart is found, the index is added to doubtfull_entry. If exactly one counterpart exists, the corresponding row’s QuantityCanceled is updated with the negative value of the canceled Quantity, and the index is added to entry_to_remove. In cases where multiple counterparts exist, rows are sorted in descending order, and the first sufficient match is updated accordingly, marking the index for removal. Finally, the code prints the counts of entries marked for removal (entry_to_remove) and those flagged as doubtful (doubtfull_entry).

 Finally, the cleaned dataset is reduced to 3,92,849 rows and 9 columns.

5.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

•	Sales trends and customer behavior are visualized using plots.

•	Patterns in purchase frequency and product preference are analysed.
 

 

5.5 Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm

•	Transactional data is prepared using one-hot encoding.
•	Frequent item sets are identified using the Apriori algorithm from mlxtend.
•	Association rules are generated to find relationships between products (e.g., if X is bought, Y is likely to be bought). 
A basket based on the transactions is formed for the particular country France. France is chosen because it has the most variety in sold products and has a suitable size to be processed in the Apriori algorithm.

 
The product is marked 1 if it exists in the transaction and 0 otherwise.
 
The displayed output shows the results of applying the Apriori algorithm to a transactional dataset, identifying frequent itemsets with a minimum support threshold of 0.07. Support measures the proportion of transactions in which an item or item combination appears. Each row represents an itemset and its corresponding support value, indicating how frequently that itemset appears in the dataset. For example, products like 'ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE GREEN', 'ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE PINK', and 'SET/6 RED SPOTTY PAPER CUPS' are frequently purchased together or individually across transactions. These results can be used for market basket analysis to derive actionable insights, such as product bundling, cross-selling strategies, and personalized recommendations to optimize sales and inventory management.

Association Rules

The Association Rules Table is generated using the Apriori algorithm with input parameters including frequent_items (frequent itemsets with a minimum support threshold of 0.07), metric="lift" (to measure the strength of associations), min_threshold=1 (to filter rules with a minimum lift value of 1), and num_itemsets=0 (to consider all possible combinations). The output includes multiple parameters: antecedents (products already in the basket), consequents (products likely to be purchased next), antecedent support (frequency of antecedent in transactions), consequent support (frequency of consequent in transactions), and support (frequency of both antecedent and consequent appearing together). Additional metrics include confidence (probability of purchasing the consequent given the antecedent), lift (strength of association, where values >1 indicate strong correlation), representativity (rule's representativeness in the dataset), leverage (difference between observed and expected support), conviction (dependency measure), zhangs_metric (novelty measure of the rule), jaccard (similarity between antecedent and consequent sets), and certainty (certainty of the association). These parameters collectively help identify significant patterns, optimize product placement, and enhance cross-selling and recommendation strategies.

o	Results Visualization

•	Rules are visualized using network graphs and bar charts.

•	Insights derived from the rules are interpreted for business recommendations.


5.6 Customer segmentation with K-means Clustering algorithm

we identify the customers by the CustomerID, we give each customer a spending score based on their total expenditure and frequency of visits, and then we apply K-means clustering.

Calculating the total expenditure for each order

Formula used : TotalExpenditure=UnitPrice×Quantity
 
Figure 5.12 Analysing the customer expenses and frequency of visits

Each customer is mapped to their total expenditure and number of visits at the retail store.
We then begin to prepare the data before applying the k-means clustering model.
 
Figure 5.13 count of customers

There are no missing values as all the customers have their corresponding expenditure and number of visits values.

One customer (Customer #13256) had a transaction of rs.0, after exploring, the transaction was found to be invalid, hence dropped from the dataset.
  
  There is a wide range of values that need to be normalized to feed to the machine learning model.
We can now assign spending scores to each customer on a scale from 1 to 100, where 1 indicates minimal expenditure and 100 represents maximum expenditure. To achieve this, we will utilize min-max scaling. The formula is as follows:
 
Figure 5.16 formula for min-max scaling
 
 The elbow method

The Elbow Method is a widely used technique to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) in K-Means clustering. It evaluates the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different values of k and plots them on a graph. As the number of clusters increases, WCSS decreases because clusters become smaller and more tightly packed. However, after a certain point, the rate of decrease slows down, forming an "elbow" on the graph. This point indicates the optimal number of clusters, balancing model performance and simplicity. In the context of the above code, the Elbow Method was applied by running the K-Means algorithm for cluster values ranging from 1 to 10 and plotting their corresponding WCSS values. The "elbow" was observed at k=4, suggesting four distinct customer segments based on Number of Visits and Spending Score. This optimal clustering helps in identifying meaningful patterns in customer behavior for targeted marketing strategies.
 
Figure 5.17 running K-Means

Now we can apply the k-means algorithm to get 4 clusters as concluded in the above step.

The code applies the KMeans clustering algorithm to group data into 4 clusters using the k-means++ initialization method for optimal centroid placement and a random state of 42 to ensure reproducibility. The fit_predict(x) method trains the model on the dataset x and assigns each data point to one of the four clusters, storing the cluster labels in y_kmeans. Finally, a new column named 'Cluster' is added to the customers_cleaned dataset, where each row is labeled with its corresponding cluster, enabling further analysis or visualization of customer segmentation.






 
CHAPTER 06
RESULTS

6.1 Results of Apriori algorithm 

Top association rules:

The main result is a table showing the top 10 association rules sorted by their lift values in descending order. Each row lists the antecedents (items that appear first), consequents (items that appear alongside the antecedents), and the lift value, which measures the strength of their association. Higher lift values indicate stronger associations between items. For instance, the rule with the highest lift value (8.920557) suggests a strong association between "ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE RED" and "ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE GREEN, POSTAGE," meaning these items are often purchased together.

The result can be visualised using a network graph.

The image depicts a product association network graph, illustrating items frequently bought together based on transactional data. Each node (circle) represents a product, and edges (lines) between nodes signify a strong association, with the thickness or weight of the edges indicating the frequency or strength of these associations. At the center lies a core product (likely the most frequently associated item), branching out to various connected products. The graph reveals clusters or patterns, such as specific products frequently paired with others (e.g., lunch boxes, themed bags, or snack boxes). This visualization helps in understanding product relationships, optimizing product placement, and creating targeted marketing or cross-selling strategies.

6.2 Results of k-means clusters 



The customer segments can be visualized using the above graph which categorizes customers into four clusters based on their spending scores and frequency of visits. Cluster 1 (red) represents customers with low spending scores and low visit frequencies. Cluster 2 (blue) includes customers with average spending scores and low visit frequencies. Cluster 3 (green) contains high-spending, high-frequency visitors, while Cluster 4 (magenta) comprises customers who spend highly but visit infrequently. The plot provides valuable insights into customer behavior, aiding in targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies by highlighting different spending patterns and visit frequencies within each cluster.
 
Figure 6.4 visits and spendings averages of clusters.

The result obtained is a table of cluster data with columns for Average Frequency of Visits, Average Spending, and Score. It lists four clusters: Cluster 1 has an average visit frequency of 39.33, spending of 1.11, and a score of 1.11; Cluster 2 has 207.62 visits, spending of 2.05, and a score of 2.05; Cluster 3 has 1819.78 visits, spending of 24.56, and a score of 24.56; Cluster 4 has 574.05 visits, spending of 4.62, and a score of 4.62. This information can be used for targeted marketing or customer segmentation based on behavior and spending patterns.













 
CHAPTER 07
CONCLUSION

Market basket analysis using the apriori algorithm can provide valuable insights for businesses in understanding customer purchasing behaviors. By identifying frequent item sets and association rules, businesses can discover patterns in customers' buying habits. For example, if customers often buy bread and butter together, the algorithm can reveal this relationship. This information allows businesses to make informed decisions about product placement, promotions, and inventory management to increase sales and customer satisfaction.
Customer segmentation can be useful in targeting specific customer groups according to their expenditure and frequency of visits, the following are few points about each customer segment obtained as a result of k-means clustering algorithm:

Cluster 1: customers with very low spending score and very low frequency of visits

Cluster 2: customers with average spending score and low frequency of visits

Cluster 3: customers with high spending scores and high frequency of visits

Cluster 4: customers with high spending scores but low frequency of visits

Business insights for the retail store to strategize according to customer segments:

Cluster 1: 

Customers with Very Low Spending Scores and Very Low Frequency of Visits
These customers have low loyalty to the store and probably low incomes/ affordability.
The best thing to do is to let them go, as spending resources to gain these customers would be a waste.
Feedback forms and surveys might help better analyse their lack in satisfaction.

Cluster 2:

Customers with a moderate spending per visit.
Their visits are relatively infrequent.
They are termed as Support.
Promotion Strategies: Offer promotions tailored to encourage more frequent visits. For example, a "visit twice this month and get 10% off your next purchase" campaign.
Product Recommendations: Suggest products based on their past purchases to increase visit frequency and spending.

Cluster 3: 

These customers are high spenders.
They visit the store frequently.
They are termed as Fans.
Loyalty Programs: These are the most valuable customers. Ensure they are part of a loyalty program that rewards their frequent and high spending.
Exclusive Offers: Provide them with exclusive offers, early access to sales, or VIP events to maintain their loyalty and encourage continued high spending.

Cluster 4:

These customers spend a lot per visit.
They visit the store infrequently.
They are termed as Roamers. 
Incentivize More Visits: Implement strategies to make them visit more frequently, such as personalized reminders, special offers, and events.
High-Value Marketing: Focus on high-value marketing campaigns that highlight premium products or services, which these customers are likely interested in.
Improve quality and functionality of ordering process and delivery.

Furthermore, the insights gained from market basket analysis can inform product development and assortment planning. By analyzing which products are frequently bought together, businesses can identify opportunities for new product offerings or modifications to existing ones. This data-driven approach ensures that businesses stay aligned with customer demands and preferences, ultimately leading to better product assortments and improved business performance.


In addition to improving product placement, market basket analysis helps in cross-selling and upselling strategies. When businesses know which products are commonly purchased together, they can bundle these items or suggest complementary products to customers. This enhances the shopping experience and encourages customers to purchase additional items, thereby boosting the average transaction value. For instance, an online retailer can recommend related products based on a customer's current cart items, increasing the likelihood of additional purchases.


Market basket analysis can also aid in targeted marketing and personalized promotions. By understanding customer preferences and purchase patterns, businesses can create tailored marketing campaigns that resonate with specific customer segments. For example, a supermarket can send personalized coupons to customers based on their previous purchase history, increasing the chances of repeat purchases and customer loyalty. This targeted approach not only enhances customer satisfaction but also optimizes marketing efforts and budgets.


In essence, market basket analysis using the apriori algorithm empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer experience, drive sales, and optimize operations.
